➔ Consistent Environments: Docker ensures consistent development and
deployment environments, minimizing "it works on my machine" issues
and providing a reliable setup for developers across different stages.
➔ Efficient Resource Utilization: The multi-stage Docker build allows for
a smaller final image, reducing the container's size and optimizing
resource utilization. This results in faster deployment times and more
efficient use of system resources.
➔ Automated Deployment Pipeline: The Jenkins pipeline automates the
build, testing, and deployment processes, improving efficiency and
reducing manual errors. This streamlined automation enhances the
reliability and speed of delivering updates to production.
